# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Mozes Sapari


Hello, Introducing my name is Mozes Sapari, I am a fresh graduate from the Department of Informatics, University of Papua, while as a student I always hone my soft skills, namely: IT Support, Network Engineer, and Full Stack Web Developer.
I always have the intention to learn and don't give up easily, so that during my studies, I can finish my studies on time, and also get a Cumlaude degree.
When I was still studying, I also often worked on several projects regarding my soft skills, both in the fields of IT Support, Network Engineer, and Web Developer, but I mostly worked on Web developer projects, so from these results, I determined my goals for being a Web Developer until now, the history of working on the project is on my LinkedIn profile.

Experience: 4 years.
Web Developer Technology : PHP (Laravel & CodeIgniter) and Java Script (Nuxt.js + Vue.js)
DBMS : MySQL + MonggoDB


So much information about me, hopefully useful :).
